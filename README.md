# Python Coursework – Data Processing Script

This repository contains a Python script developed as part of a university coursework submission. The script focuses on data processing, logical conditions, iteration, and structured output generation using core Python concepts.

The program demonstrates effective use of variables, conditional statements, loops, functions, and basic data handling techniques commonly taught in introductory programming modules.
